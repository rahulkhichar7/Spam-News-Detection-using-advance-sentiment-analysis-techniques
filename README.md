# 📰 Fake News Detection


## 🔍 Overview

In today's digital world, fake news spreads faster than ever before, creating confusion, fear, and misinformation across society. This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning-based solution** that can classify news articles as **real** or **fake** to help combat misinformation and promote trustworthy content.

We utilize multiple supervised learning algorithms and compare their performance to find the most effective method for detecting fake news.

## 📊 Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
4. **Random Forest Classifier**

## 🗂️ Dataset

A labeled dataset of news articles is used, where each article is categorized as either:

- **True**: Authentic news
- **False**: Fake or misleading news

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## 💻 System Requirements

**Hardware**:
- Minimum 4 GB RAM
- Intel i3 Processor
- At least 500 MB free disk space

**Software**:
- Anaconda (recommended for managing Python environments)
- Python 3.x

## 📦 Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```

> **Note:** The `re` (regular expressions) module is part of Python's standard library, so no separate installation is needed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulkhichar7/Spam-News-Detection-using-advance-sentiment-analysis-techniques.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd Spam-News-Detection-using-advance-sentiment-analysis-techniques
```

3. **Run the model scripts**:

Each classifier has its own script. You can run them individually, for example:

```bash
python random_forest_classifier.py
```

Or open and run the Jupyter Notebook for an interactive experience.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

Results and performance comparisons are documented in the respective script files and notebooks.

## 📚 License & Credits

This project is open-source and built for educational and research purposes.
